# pcpostman

# Used for Postman collections and environments relating to Prisma Cloud API requests

To use these collections and environment, there are a few setup pieces after importing into Postman:

-Set your access/secret key in the BODY of the /login request (Does this make sense? Should it be an env variable?)

-Set the Prisma Cloud API and Console endpoint/URL (api, api2, api3, etc) in the Env variable
